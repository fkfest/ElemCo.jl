H,He: fully atom optimized basis sets (8s) were contracted to [6s] through the 
following contraction scheme: [311111] 

Li-Ne: fully atom optimized basis sets (15s9p) were contracted to [8s6p] through 
the following contraction scheme [72111111/411111]

Na-Ar: fully atom optimized basis sets (19s13p) were contracted to [11s8p] through
the following contraction schemes {82111111111/52111111} for Na, Mg, and Pâ€“Ar
and {91111111111/52111111} for Al and Si.



The 6ZP is obtained from the above representations by addition of functions of 
higher angular quantum number than are required to describe the atom in ground 
state. To re-optimize the contraction coefficientts of the set, a subroutine to 
optimize contraction coefficients was developed and then coupled to the 
Gaussian 03 program. The DKH second-order scalar relativistic (DKH2) Hamiltonian 
as implemented in the Gaussian 03 code was used.
