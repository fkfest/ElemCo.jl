Notes about the Ahlrichs def2 basis sets
========================================

The data in the original BSE was mostly correct, with some minor disagreements
with Turbomole with respect to number of significant figures. The main
exception is the basis sets for barium, which were modified in Turbomole
sometime after they were originally uploaded to the BSE.

The original BSE also had some missing f shells for Mn in def2-QZVPD and
def2-QZVPPD.  Version 0 retains these errors.

In addition, turbomole has some basis sets for the lanthinides (gulde2012a).
These have been added.

Some coefficients for single uncontracted shells (1 primitive) were not 1.0000
(or were not set) in the Turbomole basis set files. These are also retained.

NOTE: While, in general, def2-TZVPD is the same as def2-TZVP + diffuse, this
is not always true. Some elements contain no additional diffuse functions,
and sometimes shells are removed from def2-TZVP before additional functions
are added.  This is also true in def2-SV* and def2-QZ* and when going from *ZVP
to *ZVPP.  Compare the basis sets and consult the literature for the reasons.

1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  Def2-bases form a system of segmented contracted basis sets for the
  elements H-Rn for different levels of flexibility/accuracy. The
  respective basis set types are named def2-SV(P) to def2-QZVPP. These
  basis sets are designed to give similar errors all across the
  periodic table for a given basis set type. They were tested for a set
  of ca. 300 molecules representing nearly each element in nearly all
  of its common oxidation states. These basis sets were derived from
  previous Karlsruhe bases ("def-SV(P)", etc.) in many cases.

        all over the test set, see below; "avg":average,
