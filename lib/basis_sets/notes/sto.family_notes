Notes about STO basis sets
============================

STO basis sets are formed by fitting a set of 2/3/4/5/6 exponents/coefficients to
a corresponding Slater function. A set of elements (first row main group, for example)
will share a set of coefficients and a common set of base exponents which are
multiplied by the square of an element-specific scaling factor.

The data in this library corresponds to that found in Gaussian09. Scaling
factors were taken from the literature and verified by dividing them out
of the exponents from Gaussian. The cobalt discrepancies were resolved by
reverse engineering the exponent from Gaussian using the base exponents
from other elements.

The data here is included up to 10 significant figures, which matches Gaussian.
This is more than is in the literature. According to W. Hehre, the optimizations
were likely done in higher precision (48-bit) and truncated for publication.


Reference details
-----------------

hehre1969a - Exponents/coefficients for 1s and 2sp
             Original scaling factors for H, Li-F

hehre1970a - Exponents/coefficients for 3sp
             Scaling factors for Na-Ar. Also has scaling factors
             for He and Ne, and fixes the scaling factors for Li, Be, and B.
             Since these elements derive from both hehre1969a and 1970a,
             they have both references

pietro1980a - Exponents/coefficients for 3spd and 4sp.
              The new 3sp data was re-optimized for use with elements with
              occupied 3d shells (starting at Sc)
              Scaling factors for K, Ca, Ga-Kr

pietro1981a - Exponents/coefficints for 4spd and 5sp.
              The new 4sp data was re-optimized for use with elements with
              occupied 4d shells (starting at Y)
              Scaling factors for Rb, Sr, and In-Xe

pietro1983a - Scaling factors for Sc-Zn and Y-Cd

Note that pietro1983a only specifically deals with STO-3G. However, the scaling
factors appear to be applied also to the exponents/coefficients for 2G/4G/5G/6G.


Differences with Literature
---------------------------

Gaussian uses slightly different scaling factors for cobalt.
It is unknown where these come from, but the difference is fairly small.
I have chosen to use the literature values, and have adjusted the
exponents accordingly.

GAMESS uses the literature values.

          Pietro1983a    Gaussian
          -----------    --------
    1s       26.47         26.44
    2sp      11.09         11.07
    3sp       4.55          4.56


Difference with GAMESS
----------------------

GAMESS uses a different scaling factors for some elements.

  * Factors for Na-Cl reference gordon1978a
  * Factors for 3d and 4sp shells for Sc-Zn come from Table II in the reference (pietro1983a).
    Gaussian uses the values from Table IV
  * Factors for 4d and 5sp shells for Y-Cd also come from Table II in the reference (pietro1983a).
    Gaussian uses the values from Table IV

Both codes tend to use the "Standard valence-shell scale factors" for other blocks. Therefore,
I believe Gaussian is most likely correct.

GAMESS also uses different base exponents and coefficients for some elements.

  * GAMESS uses the data from hehre1970a for all 3sp shells. For elements
    past Sc, the shells were reoptimized in pietro1980a to account for
    occupied 3d shells.
  * Similar, GAMESS uses pietro1980a for all 4sp shells. For elements
    past Y, the shells were reoptimized in pietro1981a to account for
    occupied 4d shells.
  * The source of 3d and 4d exponents/coefficients is unknown.
  * For STO-6G, the 4sp base exponents/coefficients are erroneously the same as the 3sp
