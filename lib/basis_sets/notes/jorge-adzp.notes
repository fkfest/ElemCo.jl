The original BSE had an entry for barium/ADZP. However, I do not know where the augmenting functions
came from - neto2013a states it is "not possible to construct ADZP set by extrapolation".

A set of primitive s and p functions was added to the sp sets of each DZP set of neutral atoms and 
the exponents optimized for the anion HF energy. Then an additional primitive polarization function 
was added to each of the d-polarization sets present in the neutral atoms, and the exponents of 
these functions were optimized for the ROMP2 energy of the anion. 

Thus, the ADZP basis sets have [3s2p], [5s3p2d], and [8s5p2d] functions for H, Li–Ne, and Na–Ar, 
respectively. They can be used both in the cartesian or spherical harmonic representation of the
basis functions of higher angular momentum.

These sets have the following contraction schemes:

H & He: Contracted to [2s] through the contraction scheme (3,1). 
For Li and for atoms Be-Ne: (9s5p) primitive Gaussians sets were contracted to [4s2p] through 
the contraction schemes (6111/41) and (5211/41), respectively. 
Second-row atoms (12s9p) were contracted to [7s4p] through the following contraction schemes: 
for Na (5112111/6111); for Mg–S (5111211/6111); and for Cl and Ar (5121111/6111).
