To be used with the one-electron DKH Hamiltonian, the 5ZP set was recontracted,
which incorporates the relativistic effects in the contraction coefficients. 

Jorge et al. developed DKH contracted 5ZP basis sets for Hâ€“Ar, which incorporates 
the radial changes in the wave function due to relativistic contraction and 
expansion of core and valence orbitals, respectively. 
The exponents are taken from the non-relativistic 5ZP set. They used the same 
contraction scheme as in the original contracted basis sets, i.e., only the values 
of the contraction coefficients were re-optimized using the minimum DKH2 ground 
state energy criterion for H-Ar.
