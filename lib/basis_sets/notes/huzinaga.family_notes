Notes about Huzinaga basis sets
---------------------------------

Tatewaki, Sakai and Huzinaga started a compilation of a large family of GTF basis sets.
The project may be regarded as an extension of the earlier work by Huzinaga and Sakai. The
basis sets are called mini, midi, and maxi, according to their sizes.

Extensive pilot calculations have been conducted for molecules containing atoms from H to
Cu. For example, the midi-type basis sets (421/31) and (4321/421), derived by splitting
(43/4) and (433/43) respectively, compare favorably with Popleâ€™s 4-31G and 44-316 sets when
comparisons are possible. In the present notation 4-31G is (431/31) and 44-316 is (4431/431).

Minimal Basis set:
The MINI-1 set features three gaussian expansions of each atomic orbital: since the exponents
and contraction coefficients are optimized for each element, and s and p exponents are not
constrained to be equal, these bases give much lower energies than does STO-3G. This set
represents the most extensive coverage of the elements within GAMESS, with the code-named
MINI1 basis available for all elements from Hydrogen to Radon (Z=86). A second set,
code-named MIDI4, features four gaussian orbitals for each inner shell function.

Split-valence Basis set:
The MIDI basis sets are derived from the MINI sets by floating the outermost primitive in
each valence orbitals, and renormalizing the remaining 2 gaussians. MIDI bases are not scaled
by GAMESS-UK. The transition metal basis sets are taken from sd states.
The MIDI bases are code-named MIDI1 and MIDI4.

Easton1996a presented the MIDI! basis set, which  is identified as a good compromise of speed
and accuracy, yielding excellent geometries and charge balances at a cost that is as affordable
as possible for large molecules. The basis set is optimized for molecules containing H, C, N, O,
F, P, S, and C1. Although much smaller than the popular 6-31G* basis set, in direct comparisons
it yields more accurate geometries and charges as judged by comparison to MP2/cc-pVDZ calculations.
