The hydrogenic basis sets are formed on one-electron model systems that
imitate the behavior of real atoms and molecules, where the full nuclear
charge is seen at the nucleus while far away the effective nuclear charge
goes to one for the optimized effective potential, and zero for density
functional approximations. The basis set for atom Z is obtained by optimizing
even-tempered exponents for the ground state of Z^{(Z-1)+} for every angular
momentum, and by adding more functions until all the one-electron ions
from H to Z^{(Z-1)+} are reproduced within the wanted tolerance. Augmented
basis sets are obtained by requiring the basis to be accurate also for the
Z=1/2 one-electron ion. For details on the formation of the basis sets,
see lehtola2020a.

Since the basis sets don't assume the atoms to be in a specific configuration,
they turn out to be widely transferable and accurate. Not all atoms are
accurately described by the non-augmented sets, since the potential therein
is weaker than -1/r, but the augmented sets afford excellent in these cases. I
recommend that you check whether augmentation affects your results.

A practical issue in the use of these basis sets is their high number of
diffuse functions of high angular momentum that arise from the use of a
constant effective charge model Zeff(r) = Zeff: in reality, Zeff(r) goes to
zero rapidly away from the nucleus. These diffuse functions cause significant
linear dependencies in molecular calculations, but they are not a problem
in practice since even pathological linear dependencies can be cured with a
simple Cholesky procedure that can be easily included in any pre-existing
implementation of the canonical orthogonalization procedure (lehtola2019a, lehtola2020c)
