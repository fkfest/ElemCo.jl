Notes about Ahlrichs_x2c basis sets
------------------------------------

Segmented contracted Gaussian basis sets optimized at the one-electron exact two-component (X2C) level
(including a finite size model for the nucleus) are presented by pollak2017a for elements up to Rn.
These basis sets are counterparts for relativistic all-electron calculations to the Karlsruhe “def2”
basis sets for nonrelativistic (H–Kr) or effective core potential based (Rb–Rn) treatments. For maximum
consistency, the bases presented here were obtained from the latter by modification and reoptimization.
All calculations were done with the X2C implementation in TURBOMOLE. In all cases the optimization of X2C
bases started from an existing or previously optimized nonrelativistic basis. Improved contraction coefficients
were obtained by resolving contractions and taking the MO coefficients resulting from an X2C-HF calculation
as new contraction coefficients.

Typical errors for atomization energies amount to 20(5) kJ/mol per atom at the double(triple)-ζ level, errors
for dipole moments amount to 0.5(0.1) D, and errors for HOMO energies amount to 0.5(0.1) eV. For inner shells
errors are in the range of ca. 1 eV, for the 1s orbital of heavy elements up to 5 eV, which is still not much
if compared to the energies themselves and to method-induced changes. The x2c-SV(P)all bases yield much smaller
errors than DKH-DZP bases, which are of similar size; x2c-TZVPall and Sapporo-DZP are similar to each other
concerning both size and errors.
