Notes about the Jensen basis sets
=================================

admm basis sets
------------------------
The most widely used approach to approximate the Coulomb and exchange integrals is density fitting, also known as the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation.
In this, the products of two one-electron basis functions are expanded in one-center auxiliary functions. RI significantly improves performance with a limited impact on
the accuracy and has therefore been applied to HF/KS theory as well as correlated methods. ADMM has been developed specifically for the exchange contribution. The exchange
energy is split into two parts. On consisting of the exact HF exchange and the second is a first-order correction term, evaluated as the difference between the generalized
gradient approximation exchange in the full and auxiliary basis sets.


aug-pc-n and  pc-n basis sets (where n indicates the level of polarization beyond the atomic system)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the basis sets pc-0 through pc-4, the exponents were optimized by a pseudo-Newton-Raphson approach. Molecular geometries were either taken from experimental work
or MP2/cc-pVTZ optimized.
The pc-n basis sets have been designed to systematically improve the representation of the wave function, which is the primary contributor to energetic quantities.
It is also expected that the addition of diffuse functions (aug-pc-n basis sets) will improve the performance of the excitation energies.

The Diamagnetic Spin-Orbit Contribution is insensitive to the addiion of tight functions, as their influence is only indirect by changes in the density.
The Paramagnetic Spin-Orbit Contribution provides the largest contribution to the coupling constant
The Spin Dipole Contribution provides the second largest contribution to the coupling constant

Below are the DSO PSO and SD contributions (Hz) to the spin-spin coupling in F2 (which was used as a representative case)

pcJ-n basis sets
-------------------------
Optimized for calculating indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants
using density functional methods. The calculation of nuclear magnetic spin-spin constats are a challenging task because the results largely depend on the quality of
the wave function. There are two limiting types of basis set contraction, denoted segmented and general. In a segmented contraction, each primitive basis function is
only allowed to contribute to one contracted function, while in a general contraction, all primitive functions are allowed to contribute to all contracted functions.
The contraction coefficients for a general contraction are normally obtained from SCF coefficients.
Jensen2010a performed a systematic search for the optimum contraction schemes for the pcJ-n sets and permformed extensive analysis on the s and p functions of atoms and
documented the results. The work provides guidelines for searching for optimum contraction schemes at theoretical levels, like CCSD, where a systematic search is impractical.

Below are the recommended contraction schemes for the pcJ-n Basis Sets:

pcX-n basis sets
-------------------------
The self-consistent-field method (SCF) includes orbital relaxation effects by separate optimizations of the ground and the core–hole states, and calculates the
CEBE (core-electron binding energy) as the difference between total electronic energies, and this method is widely used. The first SCF calculations were performed using HF
which ignores electron correlation and relativistic effects, but the inclusion of the relaxation energy allowed reproduction of experimental results. The SCF method can
be extended to post HF-methods such as MPn, MCSCF and CCSD methods, but they significantly increase the required computational resources and achieving convergence of the highly
excited hole state using coupled cluster methids can be difficult. PcX-n basis sets can approach the basis set limit for core-excitation processes such as XPS and XAS calculated
by the SCF approach. They are shown to provide lower basis set errors than other basis sets of similar size, and can be used as local basis sets in combination with the energy
optimized pcseg-n basis sets for reducing computational costs when core-excitation processes are only required for a small subset of atoms.


pcseg-n and psSseg-n basis sets
------------------------------------
These segmented basis sets were constructed from polarization consistent basis sets. An energy-optimized uncontracted basis set is augmented with property specific functions
to improve the basis set convergence. It is then general contracted based on the property basis set error relative to the complete basis set limit at each ζ level, and finally
converted into a computational more efficient segmented contraction by removing the redundancy among the primitive functions in the general contracted functions. The pcSseg-n
basis sets are in qualities ranging from double-ζ to pentuple-ζ quality and should be suitable for both routine and benchmark calculations of nuclear magnetic shielding constants.
While these basis sets have been developed for use with DFT methods, they may also be suitable for wave function methods including electron correlation. They can furthermore be
used as locally dense basis sets in combination with the energy-optimized pcseg-n basis sets for large systems, where shielding constants are only required for a small subset
of atoms.


pcH basis sets
--------------
Note that these differ slightly from those given in the SI of jakobsen2019a. The data here contains slight corrections.


Notes from Frank Jensen
-----------------------

pcseg:  the most recent (2014) segmented contracted version of the pc-n basis sets, defined for H-Kr, for n=0,1,2,3,4
apcseg: the most recent (2014) segmented contracted version of the aug-pc-n basis sets, defined for H-Kr, for n=0,1,2,3,4
    These should be used for DFT energetic properties (energies, geometry optimization, vibrational frequencies, ...)
    The apcseg has in addition a full set of diffuse functions, useful for anions, polar systems, and electric properties (dipole moments, polarizabilities, ...)
    NOTE: the old general contracted pc-n should be considered out-dated, as the pcseg have the same (or slightly better) performance and are computationally
        more efficient

pcSseg:  the most recent (2015) segmented contracted version of the pcS-n basis sets, defined for H-Kr, for n=0,1,2,3,4
apcSseg: the most recent (2015) segmented contracted version of the aug-pcS-n basis sets, defined for H-Kr, for n=0,1,2,3,4
    These should be used for NMR shielding constants, and have been shown to be better than other basis sets also for correlated methods (MP2, CC)
    The apcSseg has in addition a full set of diffuse functions, which may improve results for some systems
    NOTE: the old general contracted pcS-n should be considered out-dated, as the pcSseg have the same (or slightly better) performance and are computationally
        more efficient

pcJ:       the most recent contracted version of the pcJ-n basis sets, defined for H-Ar, for n=0,1,2,3,4
apcJ:      the most recent contracted version of the aug-pcJ-n basis sets, defined for H-Ar, for n=0,1,2,3,4
    These should be used for NMR spin-spin coupling constants, and are probably also close to optimum for correlated methods (MP2, CC)
    The apcJ has in addition a full set of diffuse functions, which may improve results for some systems

pcX:       basis sets optimized for core-spectroscopy, defined for Li-Ar, for n=1,2,3,4
apcX:      as pcX, with a full set of diffuse functions, defined for Li-Ar, for n=1,2,3,4
    These should be used for X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with Delta-SCF methods, especially when using DFT, but are probably also suitable for
        correlated methods (MP2, CC)
    The apcX has in addition a full set of diffuse functions, which is important/essential for XAS
    These basis sets are uncontracted, as any contraction destroys the accuracy. The n=1,2 basis sets are generated by exponent interpolation, while the n=3,4
        simply are the uncontracted versions of the original (general contracted) pc-n basis sets, as no improvement was found by exponent interpolation
    NOTE: these basis sets should not be used for XPS/XAS using response methods, as basis set requirements here are different than when using Delta-SCF methods.
        Basis sets suitable for response methods are in progress.

admm:    auxiliary basis sets for representing the exchange energy using the auxiliary-density matrix method (ADMM), defined for Li-Ar, for n=1,2,3
aadmm:    as admm, with a full set of diffuse functions, defined for Li-Ar, for n=1,2,3
    These basis sets are designed to be used in combination with pcseg-n and aug-pcseg-n, with the same n, when using the ADMM method in Dalton

Each of the directories contains the basis sets as files: ATOM-n.fmt, where fmt is a format for specific programs:
    fmt = inp  : Gaussian
    fmt = gms  : Gamess-US
    fmt = mol  : Dalton
    fmt = mol2 : Dalton, old(er) versions
