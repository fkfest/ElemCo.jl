Notes about Sauer_j basis sets
----------------------------------

Pople and dunning basis sets, optimized for the calculation of NMR indirect nuclear spin-spin
coupling constants or ESR hyperfine coupling constants with either correlated
wavefunction methods such as SOPPA and SOPPA(CCSD) or density functional
theory methods.
