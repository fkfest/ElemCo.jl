This family is largely based on the work of Dunning & Hay in dunning1977b.
These basis sets can include polarization, diffuse, and rydberg
functions.


SV basis set
------------
The Dunning-Hay split valence basis sets are moderate sized segmented
contractions, which can be used efficiently in programs that don't support
general contractions.


DZ basis sets
-------------
The set of contracted basis functions for B - F was derived from the
Huzinaga (9s,5p) primitive set using contraction coefficients taken directly
from atomic calculations.  A given primitive is not allowed to appear in
more than one contracted function, ie. these are segmented contractions.

The Al - Cl set of functions was derived from the Huzinaga (11s,7p)
primitve set. In these contractions one of the s primitives and one of p
primitives are used twice.

The neon basis is unpublished.  It was derived from the SV contraction of
Dunning and Hay.


TZ basis sets
-------------
The set of contracted basis functions for B - F was derived from the
Huzinaga (10s,6p) primitive set using contraction coefficients taken
directly from atomic calculations.


Polarization, Diffuse
---------------------
The polarization function for Ne are estimated based on neighboring elements.
Polarization functions for Li,Be,Al are taken from 6-31G*, however they are
taken to be spherical functions (rather than cartesian as in 6-31G).

The diffuse exponents were optimized at the SCF level for the negative ions.
For H, Li and Be (where exponents were not given by Dunning & Hay) the values
were obtained by simply extending the exponents in an even-tempered sense.


Rydberg and Double Rydberg
--------------------------
The single shell of Rydberg functions is designed to describe the n = 3 and n=
4 states of first row atoms.  For Ne and Ar (where exponents were not given by
Dunning & Hay) the values were estimated on the basis of neighboring elements.

The second shell of Rydberg functions is intended for the 4s, 4p and 4d
states of first row elements.  Corresponding 5s, 5p 4d exponents were not
given in the paper by Dunning & Hay, but were estimated here by scaling
the second Rydberg exponents for first row elements by the ratio of the 3s
(first row)/4s (second row).
