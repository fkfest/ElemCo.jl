After many experiments, Jorge et al. decided for 6Z basis sets:
H & He: fully atom optimized basis sets (8s) were contracted to [6s] through the 
following contraction scheme {311111}
Li-Ne: fully atom optimized basis sets (15s9p) were contracted to [8s6p] through the 
following contraction scheme {72111111/411111}
Na-Ar: fully atom optimized basis sets (19s13p) were contracted to [11s8p] through the 
following contraction schemes {82111111111/52111111} for Na, Mg, and Pâ€“Ar; 
and {91111111111/52111111} for Al and Si.
