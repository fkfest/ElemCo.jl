Notes about fitting basis sets for the dunning family
=====================================================

RIFIT for first row transition metals
-------------------------------------

The data in the original BSE is considered authoritative because it was
uploaded by the authors. This data is used in v1. Note that turbomole
obtained cc-pVTZ-RIFIT for Sc-Zn from the BSE, without obtaining the
others. I have confirmed the data is identical.

v1 also adds some missing elements, such as Ga-Kr for pV5Z-RIFIT

Original BSE
-------------

The RIFIT data in the original BSE was stored in a few different basis sets.

* cc-pVXZ-RI                   :  RI fitting basis
* aug-cc-pVXZ-RI diffuse       :  Just the diffuse functions to be added to cc-pVXZ-RI
* (aug)-cc-pVTZ MP2 Fitting    : Sc-Zn, uploaded by G. Hill
* (aug)-cc-pVXZ-NR MP2 Fitting : Analogous to '(aug)-cc-pVXZ MP2 Fitting', but used for X=Q,5
                                 (NR = nonrelativistic)

As far as I can tell, for non-TM, the original BSE did not compose the (aug) fitting
basis sets from the base and diffuse functions. I have done that for v0.


General notes
-------------
Some aux basis sets from weigend2002a were superseded
by hattig2005a. These changes were reflected in the original BSE data.

 * (aug)-cc-pVDZ for C–F
 * (aug)-cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ for Ne
