  abstract = {The coupled-cluster method restricted to single and double excitations from a closed-shell reference function (CCSD) and the corresponding quadratic configuration interaction method (QCISD) are formulated in terms of quantities which can be computed directly from the two-electron integrals in AO basis. A simple yet effective method to accelerate convergence in Brueckner coupled-cluster (BCCD) calculations is also described. Using this procedure BCCD calculations require no more effort than CCSD calculations. In order to compare the accuracy of all three methods potential energy functions and spectroscopic constants have been calculated for N2, CO, F2, and HF using large basis sets.},

  abstract = {Coupled-cluster methods offer unprecedented accuracy for a wide range of chemically important properties, but the steep scaling of computational cost with system size makes widespread use challenging. Local approximations, building on the short-range nature of electron correlation effects in insulators, help a great deal, but are much more complicated than their canonical counterparts. In this work we discuss an automated implementation scheme for local coupled-cluster methods, based on an interpreter and an underlying representation of sparse tensors. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach through implementation of a very wide range of singles-and-doubles-based coupled-cluster schemes.},

  abstract = {The coupled cluster method restricted to single and double excitations (CCSD) is considered for the case of a spin restricted Hartree{\textendash}Fock open shell reference determinant. A spin{\textendash}orbital based formulation, in which the cluster operator spans exactly the minimal first order interacting space, is presented, and computationally optimal working equations are given. In the limit of a large number of closed shell orbitals, the cost is identical to that of an optimum treatment of an equivalent closed shell problem, which is obtained as a special case of the formulation presented. The theory is applied to the calculation of a number of diatomic potential energy functions and compared with spin-unrestricted theory.},
